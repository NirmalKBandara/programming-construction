## Understanding Concurrency

### What's the Difference?

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to reveal: Concurrency vs Parallelism</strong></summary>

**Concurrency** = Juggling multiple balls (dealing with multiple things at once)
**Parallelism** = Having multiple people each juggle one ball (actually doing multiple things simultaneously)

</details>

### Visual Comparison

#### Single-Core CPU (Concurrency Only)
```
Timeline: 0----1----2----3----4----5----6----7----8
Task A:   [===]     [===]     [===]
Task B:        [===]     [===]     [===]
Task C:                                 [========]

CPU rapidly switches between tasks - they APPEAR simultaneous
```

#### Multi-Core CPU (True Parallelism)
```
Timeline: 0----1----2----3----4----5----6----7----8
Core 1:   Task A [========================]
Core 2:   Task B [========================]  
Core 3:   Task C [========================]

Tasks ACTUALLY run at the same time
```

### Benefits & Challenges

<details>
<summary><strong>Benefits of Concurrency</strong></summary>

| Benefit | Example | Real-World Impact |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Better Resource Utilization** | While Task A waits for disk read, Task B uses CPU | Up to 80% better performance |
| **Improved Responsiveness** | UI stays active while saving large files | Better user experience |
| **Higher Throughput** | Web server handles 1000s of requests | More users served |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Challenges of Concurrency</strong></summary>

| Challenge | What Goes Wrong | Simple Analogy |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Race Conditions** | Two threads modify same data | Two people editing same document |
| **Data Inconsistency** | Threads see different values | Bank balance showing different amounts |
| **Deadlocks** | Threads wait for each other forever | Two cars blocking each other |

## Processes vs Threads

### The House Analogy

Think of your computer as a **neighborhood**:

<details>
<summary><strong>Process = Entire House</strong></summary>

```
Process (Web Browser)
├── Own entrance (memory space)
├── Own security system (isolation)
├── Own utilities (system resources)
└── Residents (threads)
```

**Each house (process) has:**
- Own memory space (isolated from neighbors)
- Own resources (files, network connections)
- House number (Process ID)
- At least one resident (main thread)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Thread = Person in House</strong></summary>

```
Thread (Browser Tab)
├── Own bedroom (stack)
├── Own thoughts (program counter)
├── Own notes (registers)
└── Shares common areas (heap memory)
```

**People in same house (threads) share:**
- Kitchen (heap memory)
- Living room (file handles)
- House resources

**But each person has:**
- Own bedroom (stack)
- Own thoughts (program counter)
- Own ID (Thread ID)

</details>

### System Architecture Example

```
Computer System
├── Process 1 (Web Browser)
│   ├── Main UI Thread
│   ├── Tab 1 Thread
│   ├── Tab 2 Thread
│   └── Downloads Thread
├── Process 2 (Music Player)
│   ├── Audio Thread
│   ├── UI Thread
│   └── Network Thread
└── Process 3 (Text Editor)
    ├── Main Thread
    └── Auto-save Thread
```

### Decision Matrix: When to Use What?

<details>
<summary><strong>Use Processes When...</strong></summary>

| Scenario | Why Process? | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Need Security** | Isolation prevents crashes | Each browser tab as separate process |
| **Different Apps** | Completely separate functionality | Word processor + Media player |
| **Can Afford Overhead** | More memory usage is acceptable | Desktop applications |
| **Distributed Systems** | Running on different machines | Microservices |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Use Threads When...</strong></summary>

| Scenario | Why Thread? | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Frequent Data Sharing** | Same memory space | GUI app (UI + background work) |
| **Performance Critical** | Lower overhead | Game engine (rendering + physics) |
| **Coordinated Tasks** | Need tight cooperation | Web server handling requests |
| **Resource Efficient** | Less memory usage | Mobile applications |

## Java Threading Essentials

### Thread Lifecycle Journey

```
NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → TERMINATED
  ↓        ↑         ↓
  └→ SLEEPING ←→ BLOCKED ←→ WAITING
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Thread States Explained</strong></summary>

| State | What's Happening | Analogy |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **NEW** | Thread created but not started | Person hired but not started work |
| **RUNNABLE** | Ready to run, waiting for CPU | Person ready to work, waiting for assignment |
| **RUNNING** | Currently executing | Person actively working |
| **SLEEPING** | Voluntarily paused for time | Person taking a scheduled break |
| **BLOCKED** | Waiting for lock | Person waiting for meeting room key |
| **WAITING** | Waiting for another thread | Person waiting for colleague to finish |
| **TERMINATED** | Finished execution | Person completed work and left |

</details>

### Two Ways to Create Threads

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 1: Extending Thread Class</strong></summary>

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + getName());
    }
}

// Usage
MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start(); // Launch the thread
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 2: Implementing Runnable (Recommended)</strong></summary>

```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

// Usage
Thread thread = new Thread(new MyTask());
thread.start(); // Launch the thread
```

**Why Runnable is better:** Java single inheritance limitation - you can implement multiple interfaces!

</details>

### Thread Control Methods

<details>
<summary><strong>Essential Thread Methods</strong></summary>

| Method | Purpose | Example Use Case |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `start()` | Begin thread execution | Launch background task |
| `join()` | Wait for thread to finish | Wait for file download before processing |
| `sleep()` | Pause for specified time | Animation delays |
| `interrupt()` | Signal thread to stop | Cancel long-running operation |
| `setPriority()` | Set thread importance | UI threads get higher priority |

</details>

### Special Thread Types

<details>
<summary><strong>Daemon Threads</strong></summary>

**What are they?** Background helper threads that die when main program ends.

```java
Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up...");
        try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { break; }
    }
});
daemonThread.setDaemon(true); // Make it a daemon
daemonThread.start();

// When main program ends, daemon thread automatically stops
```

**Real Examples:**
- Garbage collector
- Timer threads
- Monitoring threads

</details>

## Synchronization Deep Dive

### The Problem: Race Conditions

<details>
<summary><strong>What Goes Wrong Without Synchronization?</strong></summary>

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;
    
    // DANGER: Not synchronized!
    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {          // Thread A checks: 1000 >= 500 ✓
                                         // Thread B checks: 1000 >= 700 ✓
            balance = balance - amount;   // Thread A: 1000 - 500 = 500
                                         // Thread B: 1000 - 700 = 300
        }
    }
}

// Result: Balance could be 500 OR 300, depending on timing!
// Expected: Should reject one withdrawal when balance < 700
```

</details>

### Solution 1: Synchronized Methods

<details>
<summary><strong>Method-Level Synchronization</strong></summary>

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;
    
    // Only ONE thread can access this method at a time
    public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println("Withdrawing: " + amount);
            balance = balance - amount;
            System.out.println("New balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds!");
        }
    }
    
    public synchronized int getBalance() {
        return balance; // Also synchronized for consistency
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Locks the **entire object** for the method duration
- Other synchronized methods must wait
- Thread-safe but potentially slower

</details>

### Solution 2: Synchronized Blocks (Better!)

<details>
<summary><strong>Block-Level Synchronization</strong></summary>

```java
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;
    private String accountInfo = "John Doe";
    
    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        // Multiple threads can enter method
        
        System.out.println("Processing withdrawal request...");
        
        synchronized(this) {  // Only critical section is locked
            if (balance >= amount) {
                balance = balance - amount;
            }
        } // Lock released immediately
        
        System.out.println("Transaction logged");
    }
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Faster: Only locks critical sections
- More precise control
- Better concurrency

</details>

### Advanced: Fine-Grained Synchronization

<details>
<summary><strong>Multiple Locks for Different Resources</strong></summary>

```java
public class SmartBankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;
    private String accountInfo = "John Doe";
    private List<String> transactionHistory = new ArrayList<>();
    
    // Separate locks for different resources
    private final Object balanceLock = new Object();
    private final Object infoLock = new Object();
    private final Object historyLock = new Object();
    
    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        synchronized(balanceLock) {  // Only locks balance operations
            if (balance >= amount) {
                balance -= amount;
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void updateInfo(String newInfo) {
        synchronized(infoLock) {  // Different lock for account info
            accountInfo = newInfo;
        }
    }
    
    public void addTransaction(String transaction) {
        synchronized(historyLock) {  // Another lock for history
            transactionHistory.add(transaction);
        }
    }
    
    // These three methods can run SIMULTANEOUSLY!
}
```

**Performance Boost:** Operations on different data can run in parallel!

</details>

### Reentrant Synchronization

<details>
<summary><strong>Same Thread, Multiple Locks</strong></summary>

```java
class ReentrantExample {
    public synchronized void methodA() {
        System.out.println("In methodA");
        methodB(); // Can same thread call another synchronized method?
    }
    
    public synchronized void methodB() {
        System.out.println("In methodB");
        // YES! Same thread can acquire same lock multiple times
    }
}
```

**Why it works:** Java tracks lock ownership by thread, not just lock acquisition.

## Threading Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Deadlock - "Mexican Standoff"

<details>
<summary><strong>The Classic Deadlock Scenario</strong></summary>

```java
class DeadlockDemo {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();
    
    public void method1() {
        synchronized(lock1) {           // Thread A gets lock1
            System.out.println("Thread A: Got lock1");
            
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            
            synchronized(lock2) {       // Thread A waits for lock2
                System.out.println("Thread A: Got lock2");
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void method2() {
        synchronized(lock2) {           // Thread B gets lock2
            System.out.println("Thread B: Got lock2");
            
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            
            synchronized(lock1) {       // Thread B waits for lock1
                System.out.println("Thread B: Got lock1");
            }
        }
    }
}

// Result: Both threads wait forever!
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deadlock Prevention: Lock Ordering</strong></summary>

```java
class DeadlockFixed {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();
    
    public void method1() {
        synchronized(lock1) {       // Always acquire lock1 first
            synchronized(lock2) {   // Then lock2
                System.out.println("Thread A: Both locks acquired");
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void method2() {
        synchronized(lock1) {       // Same order: lock1 first
            synchronized(lock2) {   // Then lock2
                System.out.println("Thread B: Both locks acquired");
            }
        }
    }
}

// Result: Sequential execution, no deadlock!
```

**Golden Rule:** Always acquire locks in the same order!

</details>

### Problem 2: Starvation - "Never My Turn"

<details>
<summary><strong>When Low Priority Threads Never Get Resources</strong></summary>

```java
class StarvationExample {
    public synchronized void importantWork() {
        // High priority threads keep calling this
        System.out.println("High priority work");
    }
    
    public synchronized void backgroundWork() {
        // Low priority threads never get a chance
        System.out.println("Background work");
    }
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Use fair locks: `ReentrantLock(true)`
- Time-bounded waiting
- Priority scheduling algorithms

</details>

### Problem 3: Livelock - "After You!" "No, After You!"

<details>
<summary><strong>The Overly Polite Threads</strong></summary>

```java
class LivelockExample {
    static class PoliteWorker {
        private String name;
        private boolean active;
        
        public PoliteWorker(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            this.active = true;
        }
        
        public void work(PoliteWorker colleague) {
            while (active) {
                if (colleague.active) {
                    System.out.println(name + ": After you, " + colleague.name);
                    active = false;  // I'll step back
                    
                    try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                    
                    active = true;   // Let me try again
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Both workers keep stepping aside for each other!
    // They're not blocked, but no work gets done
}
```

**Solution:** Add randomization or timeout to break the cycle.

### Synchronization Quick Guide

| Technique | Use When | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|----------|------|------|
| `synchronized method` | Simple cases | Easy to use | Can be slow |
| `synchronized block` | Most cases | Precise control | Need to choose lock object |
| Multiple locks | Complex objects | Better performance | Deadlock risk |

### Problem Prevention Checklist

- [ ] **Deadlock**: Always acquire locks in same order
- [ ] **Starvation**: Use fair locks or time limits  
- [ ] **Livelock**: Add randomization to retry logic
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: Synchronize shared resource access

### Best Practices Summary

1. **Minimize synchronized sections** - Lock only what you must
2. **Prefer Runnable over Thread** - Better flexibility
3. **Use private lock objects** - Avoid external interference
4. **Don't hold locks longer than necessary** - Release quickly
5. **Test thoroughly** - Concurrency bugs are sneaky!
